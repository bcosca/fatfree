		<h3>Dynamic PHP Applications The Fast and Easy Way</h3>
		<p>The first thing you might want to do is visualize your directory structures. Fat-Free gives you total control over your Web site. Organize your folders in any way that pleases you (or your development team if you're part of a group). Decide where you want to store the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Application and code libraries</li>
			<li>HTML templates</li>
			<li>Graphics and media files</li>
			<li>Javascript and CSS files</li>
			<li>Database (if you plan to use an embedded DB like SQLite)</li>
			<li>Configuration files</li>
			<li>Uploads/Downloads</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For security reasons, consider relocating the <code>lib/</code> folder to a path that's not Web-accessible. If you decide to move this folder, just change the line in <code>index.php</code> containing <code>require 'lib/base.php';</code> so it points to the new location. The <code>lib/</code> folder also contains framework plug-ins that extend F3's capabilities. You can change the default location of all plug-ins by moving the files to your desired subdirectory. Then, it's just a matter of pointing the <code>PLUGINS</code> global variable to the new location. You may delete the plug-ins that you don't need. You can always restore them later.</p>
		<p>F3 can autoload OOP classes for you. Just add the path to the <code>AUTOLOAD</code> variable.</p>
		<p>When you're ready to write your F3-enabled site, you can start editing the rest of the code contained in the <code>index.php</code> file that displayed this Web page. Developing PHP applications will never be the same!</p>
		<h3>PHP Dependencies</h3>
		<p>Some framework features in this version (<?php echo $VERSION; ?>) will not be available if PHP is not configured with the modules needed by your application.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>Framework class/Plug-in</td>
				<td>PHP Module</td>
			</tr>
			<?php foreach ($classes as $class=>$modules): ?>
				<tr>
				<td><code><?php echo $class; ?></code></td>
				<td>
					<?php foreach ($modules as $module): ?>
					<input type="checkbox" <?php echo extension_loaded($module)?'checked="checked"':''?> /> <code><?php echo $module; ?></code><br />
					<?php endforeach; ?>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<?php endforeach; ?>
		</repeat>
		</table>
		<ul>
		<li>The <code>Base</code> class requires all listed PHP modules enabled to function properly.</li>
		<li>The <code>Cache</code> class will use any available module in the list. If none can be found, it will use the filesystem as fallback.</li>
		<li>The <code>DB\SQL</code> class requires the <code>pdo</code> module and a PDO driver relevant to your application.</li>
		<li>The <code>Web</code> class will use the <code>curl</code> module for HTTP requests to another server. If this is not detected, it will use other transports available, such as the HTTP stream wrapper or native sockets.</li>
		<li>The <code>geoip</code> module listed in the <code>Web\Geo</code> class is optional; the class will use an alternative Web service for geo-location.</li>
		<li>Other framework classes in the list need all its listed modules enabled.</li>
		</ul>
