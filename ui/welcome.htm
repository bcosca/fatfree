	<h3>Version <?php echo $VERSION; ?></h3>
	<p>The first thing you might want to do is visualize your directory structures. Fat-Free gives you total control over your Web site. Organize your folders in any way that pleases you (or your development team if you're part of a group). Decide where you want to store the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Application and code libraries</li>
		<li>HTML templates</li>
		<li>Graphics and media files</li>
		<li>Javascript and CSS files</li>
		<li>Database (if you plan to use an embedded DB like SQLite)</li>
		<li>Configuration files</li>
		<li>Uploads/Downloads</li>
	</ul>
	<p>For security reasons, consider relocating the <code>lib/</code> folder to a path that's not Web-accessible. If you decide to move this folder, just change the line in <code>index.php</code> containing <code>require 'lib/base.php';</code> so it points to the new location. The <code>lib/</code> folder also contains framework plug-ins that extend F3's capabilities. You can change the default location of all plug-ins by moving the files to your desired subdirectory. Then, it's just a matter of pointing the <code>PLUGINS</code> global variable to the new location. You may delete the plug-ins that you don't need. You can reinstate them later as you find necessary.</p>
	<p>F3 can autoload OOP classes for you. Just add the path to the <code>AUTOLOAD</code> variable.</p>
	<p>When you're ready to write your F3-enabled site, you can start editing the rest of the code contained in the <code>index.php</code> file that displayed this Web page. Developing PHP applications will never be the same!</p>
	<h3>PHP Dependencies</h3>
	<p>Some framework features in this version will not be available if PHP is not configured with the modules needed by your application.</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Class/Plug-in</th>
			<th>PHP Module</th>
		</tr>
		<?php foreach ($classes as $class=>$modules): ?>
			<tr>
			<td><code><?php echo $class; ?></code></td>
			<td>
				<?php foreach ($modules as $module): ?>
				<input type="checkbox" <?php echo extension_loaded($module)?'checked="checked"':''?> onclick="return false" /> <code><?php echo $module; ?></code><br />
				<?php endforeach; ?>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<?php endforeach; ?>
	</table>
	<ul>
	<li>The <code>Base</code> class requires all listed PHP modules enabled to function properly.</li>
	<li>The <code>Cache</code> class will use any available module in the list. If none can be found, it will use the filesystem as fallback.</li>
	<li>The <code>DB\SQL</code> class requires the <code>pdo</code> module and a PDO driver relevant to your application.</li>
	<li>The <code>Bcrypt</code> class will use the <code>mcrypt</code> or <code>openssl</code> module for entropy generation. Otherwise, it employs a custom random function.</li>
	<li>The <code>Web</code> class will use the <code>curl</code> module for HTTP requests to another server. If this is not detected, it will use other transports available, such as the HTTP stream wrapper or native sockets.</li>
	<li>The <code>geoip</code> module listed in the <code>Web\Geo</code> class is optional; the class will use an alternative Web service for geo-location.</li>
	<li>Other framework classes in the list need all its listed modules enabled.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Need Help?</h3>
	<p>If you have any questions regarding the framework, technical support is available at <code><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/f3-framework">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/f3-framework</a></code></p>
	<p>Need live support? You can talk to the development team and the rest of the Fat-Free community via IRC. We're on the FreeNode (<code>chat.freenode.net</code>) <code>#fatfree</code> channel. If the channel appears quiet, the development team might just be busy with the next great release, or it's probably due to time zone differences. Just hang around.</p>
